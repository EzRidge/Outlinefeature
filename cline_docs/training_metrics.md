Time: 00:58:58 UTC

### Configuration
- Instance: ml.m5.xlarge (CPU)
- Image size: 512x512
- Batch size: 2
- Workers: 2
- Max samples: 10
- Dataset: RID only
- Epochs: 1

### Data Loading
```
[INFO] Successfully loaded 1534 image/mask pairs
[INFO] Limiting dataset to 10 samples (from 1534)
[INFO] Created dataloaders:

### Issues/Warnings
- None so far

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete training without OOM errors
- [ ] Stable loss values
- [ ] Model saves successfully
- [ ] No data loading issues

### Next Steps
1. Wait for training completion
2. Document final metrics
3. Analyze memory headroom
4. Plan Phase 1 scaling (20 samples)

### Notes
- Will update with final metrics when training completes
- Watching for any memory pressure signs
- Monitoring loss convergence
- Tracking batch processing time
