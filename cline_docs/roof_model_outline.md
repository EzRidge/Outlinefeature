# Roof Analysis Model Implementation Plan

## Post-Training Workflow

1. **Input Processing**
   - Model accepts aerial imagery of roofs
   - Images can be from various zoom levels (will be normalized internally)
   - Supports multiple input formats (JPEG, PNG)

2. **Model Analysis**
   - **Segmentation**: Identifies different roof elements
     - PV modules
     - Dormers
     - Windows
     - Ladders
     - Chimneys
     - Shadows
     - Trees
     - Other features
   
   - **Line Detection**
     - Ridge lines (shown in red)
     - Valley lines (shown in purple)
     - Edge lines (shown in green)
     - Generates complete roof outline
   
   - **Depth Estimation**
     - Provides 3D structure understanding
     - Helps with pitch and elevation changes

3. **Output Generation**
   - Segmentation masks for each feature
   - Colored line visualization (like the example image)
   - Measurements and dimensions
   - JSON output with all detected features and coordinates

4. **Integration Options**
   - **Microservice Approach**
     - Deploy as separate API service
     - Main app sends images and receives results
     - Easier to maintain and scale
     - Can be hosted on separate infrastructure
   
   - **Direct Integration**
     - Convert model to ONNX.js/TensorFlow.js
     - Run directly in Node.js application
     - Lower latency
     - Self-contained solution
