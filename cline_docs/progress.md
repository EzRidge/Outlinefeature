# Project Progress

## Current Phase: SageMaker Training Setup

### Completed Tasks
1. Initial model architecture (HybridRoofModel)
   - ResNet50 backbone
   - Multi-task heads for segmentation, lines, and depth
   - Custom loss functions

2. Dataset loading and preprocessing
   - Support for RID, Roofline, and AIRS datasets
   - Proper file extension handling
   - Mask value remapping
   - Memory optimization

3. SageMaker infrastructure
   - Basic training script
   - Data channel configuration
   - Metrics tracking setup

### In Progress
1. Testing SageMaker training pipeline
   - Using reduced dataset size for quick iteration
   - CPU instance for initial testing
   - Binary mask conversion for RID dataset

### Next Steps
1. Short term (Testing)
   - Test with small sample size (20 samples)
   - Verify data loading and training loop
   - Check loss calculation and metrics

2. Medium term (Scaling)
   - Move to G5 GPU instance
   - Scale up to full dataset
   - Restore original image size (1024x1024)
   - Increase batch size (16+)

3. Long term (Improvements)
   - Add proper mask value mapping
   - Fine-tune model architecture
   - Optimize training parameters
   - Add model evaluation metrics

### Technical Debt
1. Mask value mapping
   - Currently using binary conversion
   - Need to map azimuth classes properly
   - Consider class distribution

2. Memory optimization
   - Currently using reduced settings
   - Need to profile memory usage
   - Consider gradient accumulation

3. Error handling
   - Add more robust error messages
   - Improve recovery from failed samples
   - Add validation checks

### Documentation
1. Updated files:
   - cline_docs/sagemaker_training.md (New)
   - src/data.py
   - notebooks/sagemaker_training.ipynb

2. Needed updates:
   - Model architecture documentation
   - Training parameters guide
   - Evaluation metrics documentation

## Timeline
1. Current Sprint (Testing)
   - Get training working with small dataset
   - Fix any remaining issues
   - Document progress

2. Next Sprint (Scaling)
   - Move to GPU instance
   - Scale up to full dataset
   - Optimize performance

3. Future Sprint (Refinement)
   - Improve mask handling
   - Add advanced features
   - Fine-tune model
